# Unit Testing Best Practices

# What is unit testing ?

Unit testing occurs during the coding phase of the software development lifecycle, and it helps identify coding errors, code quality issues, and security issues.

Unit tests are typically created by developers during the coding phase of a project and are written as code that exists in the codebase alongside the application code it is testing.

A unit may be a function, procedure, method, object or module.

A unit test validates and verifies individual software units to ensure each unit works as intended.
